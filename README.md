# Sorting Algorithms in C++

## Overview
This project implements various sorting algorithms in C++ to demonstrate their functionality and efficiency. The algorithms included are:

- **Insertion Sort** (Standard and Binary Insertion)
- **Selection Sort**
- **Shell Sort**
- **Merge Sort**

The program tracks and displays the number of comparisons and shifts (or moves) performed by each algorithm, allowing for performance assessment and comparison.

## Features
- **Insertion Sort**: 
  - Implements both standard and binary insertion sort methods.
  - Counts and displays the number of comparisons and shifts during the sorting process.

- **Selection Sort**: 
  - Implements the selection sort algorithm.
  - Counts and displays the number of comparisons and moves made while sorting.

- **Shell Sort**: 
  - Implements the shell sort algorithm.
  - Counts and displays the number of comparisons and moves during sorting.

- **Merge Sort**: 
  - Implements the merge sort algorithm.
  - Counts and displays the number of comparisons and moves during sorting.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Program**: Start the program to access sorting options.
2. **Input Data**: Enter the size of the array and the array elements when prompted.
3. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose the desired sorting algorithm to execute.
4. **View Results**: After sorting, the program will display the sorted array along with the metrics for comparisons and shifts or moves.

## Requirements
- **C++ Compiler** (C++11 or higher)

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for this project include:
- Adding more sorting algorithms for comparison (e.g., Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Allowing the user to compare performance metrics across different algorithms visually.
